# leetcode-solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems. Each solution is written in Python and organized in dedicated folders by problem name. I use optimized approaches and provide explanations for each solution.

## Folder Structure

- Each folder corresponds to a specific LeetCode problem.
- Each folder contains:
  - The solution file (e.g., `two_sum.py`).
  - A `README.md` file explaining the problem, approach, and complexity analysis.

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the folder of the problem you're interested in.
2. Read the `README.md` file to understand the solution approach.
3. Review the code for implementation details.
